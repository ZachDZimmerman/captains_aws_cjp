# Bibliography

This is a list of the references I used while experimenting and learning.

- First steps with Terraform: [initial setup](https://pragmacoders.com/2-creating-an-ec2-instance-with-terraform/) and [setting up SSH](https://pragmacoders.com/3-installing-rails-with-terraform/) 
- Terraform and Ansible: https://alex.dzyoba.com/blog/terraform-ansible/. See also [this article](https://getintodevops.com/blog/using-ansible-with-terraform) on the same subject with some advise about Jenkins.
